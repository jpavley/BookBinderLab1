/// Models a BookBinder Series with Works and Variants in JSON.
/// - `Publisher` has a name and contains a list of series.
/// - `Series` has a title, a list of characters, and a list of volumes.
/// - `Volume` has a kind (publishing frequency), era (year), number, set of properties used to
///   calculate uncollected works (firstWorkNumber, currentWorkNumber, list of skippedWorkNumbers),
///   and a list of works.
/// - `Work` has a number and a list of variants.
/// - `Variant` has a date published, kind (publishing media), printing, letter, coverID,
///   dateCollected, and dateConsumed (consumption properties used to determin ownership and
///   tracking.
/// - *Note: each work has a URI, which are used as keys to identify works in a dictionary but
///   URIs are calucated at runtime so not serialized in JSON except for the selectedURI which
///   lets an app know what the user was looking at the time of serialization.*
