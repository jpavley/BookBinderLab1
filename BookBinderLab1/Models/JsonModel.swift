/**
 Models a serializable `Publisher` list with `Series`, `Volumes`, `Works`, and `Variants` in JSON.
 See [schema] for JSON schema. See [sample1.json] for example implementation.
 - Note:
    - A publisher is an entity that creates and publically distributes works of art (books, movies, games, etc).
    - A series is a set of related works published in succession (trilogy, sequals, serial, etc).
    - A volume is a marketed subset of a series (boxed set, collected issues, vol. II).
    - A work is a creative product published and distributed.
    - A variant is a particular expression of work in a medium (paperback, hardcover, digital, disc).
